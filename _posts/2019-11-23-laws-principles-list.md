Different principles used when discussing Software Development and Delivery processes.

* [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)

> Organizations which design systemsâ€¦ are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

* [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)

> Entities should not be multiplied without necessity.
> The simplest solution is most likely the right one.

* [Halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)

> The problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running, or continue to run forever.

* [Brooks's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)

> Adding human resources to a late software project makes it later.

* [Theory of Constraints](https://www.leanproduction.com/theory-of-constraints.html)

> A methodology for identifying the most important limiting factor (i.e. constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal and then systematically improving that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor. In manufacturing, the constraint is often referred to as a bottleneck.

* [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

> For many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

* [Conjunction fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy)

> Assuming that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.

* [Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)
